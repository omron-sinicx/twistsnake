overview: >
  Table-top robotic arms have been developed in research and are commercially available.
  These arms must be lightweight for safety.
  Therefore, this study aims to design a lightweight table-top robotic arm.
  We adopt a cable-driven mechanism used for lightweight robots.
  Particularly, we focus on locating all motors at the base link and using plastic structural parts to decrease the weight of a cable-driven robotic arm more.
  However, locating all motors at the base link results in a significant distance between a driving motor and driven joint, increases the number of parts for the force transmission.
  Using plastic structural parts increases the risk of a cable loosening and coming off of a pulley.
  To overcome these issues, this study proposed a novel cable-driven robotic arm named Twist Snake.
  We designed a joint composition of Twist Snake to minimize the number of parts for the force transmission. In addition, it has a compact cable-pretension/termination-mechanism and covering parts to prevent the cable from loosening and coming off of the pulley.
  The arm comprised 475 mm long moving links with an 802 g.
  The feasibility of the arm was experimentally demonstrated by contact-rich tasks, the insertion of a toy peg into a hole, and swiping a whiteboard with a cleaner.

      The motors located at the base link drive the joints via cables. 
      This drawing shows the bottom side cables.
      The arm does not have any pretension mechanism between the motors and the termination location in moving links.

      This mechanism compact adds pretension to a cable by reeling this and fixes the cable to a link by inserting a pin.
  - title: Covering parts to cable-coming-off

      Joint parts cover pulleys to avoid cable-coming-off. 
      If a cable is slacked once, this cable can go back to a pulley by being covered.
